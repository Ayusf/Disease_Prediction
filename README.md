# Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning

A machine learning system that predicts diseases based on patient symptoms using Logistic Regression. Developed as an end-to-end project from data analysis to web deployment.

## Features

- **38-disease classifier** including Hepatitis variants, Tuberculosis, Malaria, etc.
- **10-symptom input**: fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, joint pain, skin rash, cough, weight loss, yellow eyes
- **Web interface** for easy user interaction
- **REST API endpoint** for integration with other systems
- **Model comparison** of 4 different algorithms

## Dataset

- **2000 patient records** with symptom-disease mappings
- **Class distribution**:
  - Paralysis (brain hemorrhage): 90 cases
  - Hepatitis B: 80 cases
  - Impetigo: 80 cases
